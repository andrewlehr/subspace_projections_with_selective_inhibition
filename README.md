# Spatially heterogeneous inhibition projects sequential activity onto unique neural subspaces
by Lehr, Kumar, and Tetzlaff

Code to produce the figures from abovementioned manuscript.
The code is separated into the rate model and spiking model.
There are notebooks to produce each of the figures.
For the rate model there is a package called "submanifolds" which contains the code to run the simulations.
For the spiking model, the code is adapted from Leo Hiselius' implementation (see https://github.com/leohiselius/spreizer-net) of the model by Spreizer et al 2019, Plos CB.
